# Spellbound

**It knows your words. Not you.**

A privacy-first, on-device spell-checker for iOS that learns only from what you type. No cloud. No tracking. No server.

## About

Spellbound is a minimal spell-checking app built on the principle that your words belong to you. Everything runs on-device using a 300MB FastText model. Nothing leaves your phone unless you choose to export it.

### Core Features

- **On-device learning**: Learns from your corrections, stored locally
- **300MB FastText model**: Offline language processing, no API calls
- **Zero tracking**: No analytics, no crash reporting, no third-party SDKs
- **Optional peer-to-peer**: Bluetooth mesh learning (opt-in, anonymous)
- **Data ownership**: Export your typing patterns as a hash. Sell it. Keep 100%.

### Philosophy

Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

We believe:
- Your words are yours
- Learning should happen locally
- AI doesn't need surveillance
- You should own your data completely
